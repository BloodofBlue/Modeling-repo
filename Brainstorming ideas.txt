Old world magic- world falling apart maybe?
Person looking back on their childhood and mourning what used to be?

Darkness comes instead- anime opening style badassery?
This one just feels like a theme song for a tv show, yknow? 

spent a bit thinking about it, probably gonna use the first song


honestly im not doing a lot with this yet i straight up do not have time to before monday cuz of other things due then


I have been listening to the song on loop and I don't have anything solid yet, but I'm definitely gonna go with the person looking back on their childhood thing. I have some cool ideas for it that I just need to hammer out a bit more before I can actually draw them out.
